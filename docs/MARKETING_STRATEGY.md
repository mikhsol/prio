# Jeeves - Marketing Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the marketing strategy for Jeeves, a privacy-first, offline-capable personal assistant powered by on-device AI. Our initial focus is the Android platform, targeting productivity-focused users who value privacy and simplicity.

**Strategic Imperative**: Competitors will respond within 12-18 months. First-mover advantage in "private AI productivity" is time-limited.

**Phased Growth Targets**:
| Phase | Timeframe | Target Users | Focus |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (MVP) | Months 1-6 | 50,000 | Privacy-conscious tech professionals |
| Phase 2 (Growth) | Months 6-18 | 500,000 | All overwhelmed professionals |
| Phase 3 (Scale) | Year 2+ | 5,000,000 | Mass market Android users |

**Beachhead Market**: Privacy-conscious Android professionals in tech and creative industries—vocal advocates who validate core differentiation before broader expansion.

- "TickTick syncs to Chinese servers. Jeeves never leaves your phone."

**vs. Google Tasks:**

- "Google Tasks is basic. Jeeves is intelligent."

**vs. Things 3:**
- "Things 3 is iOS-only. Jeeves brings privacy-first productivity to Android."
- "Things 3 has no AI. Jeeves thinks for you."

### Threat Assessment & Response Timeline

| Competitor | Likely Response | Threat Level | Timeline |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Google Tasks** | Integrate Gemini | High | 6-12 months |
| **Microsoft To Do** | Copilot integration | Medium | Already started |
| **Todoist** | Add basic AI features | Medium | 12-18 months |

## Pricing & Conversion Strategy

### Pricing Model (Validated by Persona Willingness-to-Pay)

Based on persona research:
- **Alex (Professional)**: Willing to pay $10/mo
- **Maya (Privacy Creator)**: Willing to pay $5/mo, prefers lifetime
- **Jordan (Achiever)**: Free tier only, convert later

| Tier | Price | Features | Target Persona |
|------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Free** | $0 | Basic tasks, 5 AI classifications/day, 3 goals, calendar read | Jordan (hook & convert later) |
| **Pro** | $6.99/mo or $59.99/yr | Unlimited AI, full goals, briefings, analytics, meeting notes | Alex + Maya |
| **Pro+** | $12.99/mo or $99.99/yr | Pro + Cloud AI (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok), 5 custom agents | Power users |
| **Lifetime** | $99.99 (one-time) | All Pro features forever | Maya (privacy + no subscription) |

| **Pro** | $6.99/mo | Unlimited AI, full goals, briefings, analytics |
| **Lifetime** | $99.99 | All Pro features forever |

### Pricing Rationale

- **$6.99 Pro**: Split difference between Alex ($10 WTP) and Maya ($5 WTP)
- **$99.99 Lifetime**: ~14 months of Pro - appeals to Maya's subscription fatigue

- **Low Operational Cost**: On-device AI = profitable at lower prices than competitors

### Conversion Strategy

#### Free-to-Paid Triggers
- After 5 goals created (goal limit soft paywall)
- After 30 days active (analytics upgrade prompt)
- After meeting notes used 3x (AI summarization premium feature)
- End of free trial for cloud sync

#### Messaging

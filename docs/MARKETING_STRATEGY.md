#### Direct Competitors (Todo/Productivity Apps)

| App | Downloads | Strengths | Weaknesses | Opportunity |

| **Todoist** | 50M+ | Clean UI, cross-platform, integrations | No AI, cloud-required, subscription | Local AI + offline-first |
| **TickTick** | 10M+ | Feature-rich, Pomodoro, Eisenhower | Cluttered, privacy concerns | Simpler UX + privacy |
| **Microsoft To Do** | 50M+ | Free, Microsoft integration | Basic, no AI, cloud-only | AI features + independence |

## Positioning

### Positioning Statement
For busy professionals who struggle with priorities and distrust cloud-based AI, Jeeves is the on-device personal assistant that brings clarity to your tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix—all while keeping your data private on your phone. Unlike Todoist or TickTick, Jeeves uses AI that runs locally, works offline, and never sends your personal data to the cloud.

### Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **On-Device AI** | LLM runs on your phone | Privacy guaranteed, works offline |
| **Eisenhower-First** | Priority matrix is core UX | Clarity on what matters |
| **Goal-Connected** | Tasks link to goals | See progress toward outcomes |
| **Offline-First** | No internet required | Reliable, no latency |
| **Lifetime Option** | One-time purchase available | No subscription fatigue |

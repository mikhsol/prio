**Demographics:**
- Age: 32
- Occupation: Senior Product Manager at a mid-size tech company
- Location: Austin, TX
- Income: $130,000/year
- Device: Pixel 8 Pro

**Bio:**  
Alex manages multiple product lines and juggles endless meetings, emails, and competing priorities. They've tried Todoist, Notion, and even paper planners, but nothing sticks. By Wednesday, their task list is overwhelming, and they spend more time organizing than doing.

### Goals
1. **Regain control** of their workload and stop feeling overwhelmed
2. **Focus on what matters** instead of firefighting
3. **Make progress on career goals** while handling daily demands
4. **End each day feeling accomplished**, not exhausted

### Pain Points
1. **Prioritization paralysis**: "I have 50 tasks and don't know where to start"
2. **Context switching fatigue**: "I jump between projects and lose track"
3. **Goal disconnect**: "My quarterly objectives never translate to daily work"
4. **Tool fatigue**: "I've tried everything—nothing fits my workflow"
5. **Meeting overload**: "Half my day is meetings, action items get lost"

### Behaviors

- Feels guilty about incomplete tasks

- Comfortable with AI (uses ChatGPT for work)
- Privacy-aware but trades off for convenience
- Android user (work phone flexibility)
- Prefers keyboard shortcuts and efficiency

### Quote
> "I need something that tells me what to work on next, not another app that just stores my tasks."

### Jeeves Value Proposition for Alex
- **AI prioritization** removes decision fatigue
- **Eisenhower automation** surfaces what truly matters
- **Meeting action extraction** captures commitments automatically

### Goals
1. **Stay organized** across multiple client projects
2. **Protect client confidentiality** (NDAs, sensitive work)
3. **Build sustainable work habits** as a solo entrepreneur
4. **Grow her business** while maintaining work-life balance

### Pain Points

2. **Client confidentiality**: "I can't put client project names in cloud apps"
3. **Inconsistent income/work**: "Some weeks are chaos, others are slow"
4. **No team support**: "I have to manage everything myself"
5. **Burnout risk**: "I work all hours and forget to stop"

### Behaviors

- Researches apps before installing (checks privacy policy)
- Avoids Google and Microsoft ecosystems

### Technology Profile
- Selective tech adoption (quality over quantity)

- Prefers open-source when possible
- Android user (avoids Apple and Google ecosystems)
- Will pay premium for privacy-respecting tools

### Quote
> "I'd love an AI assistant, but I'm not uploading my client list to someone's cloud."

### Jeeves Value Proposition for Maya
- **On-device AI** means zero cloud exposure
- **Offline-first** works without internet

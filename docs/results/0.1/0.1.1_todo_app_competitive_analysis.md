## Market Gaps Identified

### 1. AI-Powered Prioritization
No competitor offers true AI-powered Eisenhower classification. TickTick has the view but requires manual assignment. **Opportunity: Automatic urgency/importance detection.**

### 2. On-Device AI / Privacy
All AI features require cloud processing. No competitor offers on-device AI for privacy-conscious users. **Opportunity: Local LLM for task processing.**

### 3. Intelligent Briefings
Any.do's "Plan My Day" and Microsoft's "My Day" are basic. Neither offers AI-generated contextual briefings. **Opportunity: Morning/evening AI briefings.**

### 4. Goal-Task Integration
Goals are separate apps (Strides, Way of Life). No todo app deeply integrates goals with daily tasks. **Opportunity: Goals as first-class citizens with task linking.**

### 5. Meeting-Task Bridge
Calendar integration exists but meeting-to-task conversion is manual. **Opportunity: AI extraction of action items from meeting notes.**

## Competitive Positioning Recommendations

1. **Primary Differentiator**: On-device AI for privacy + intelligent prioritization
2. **Secondary Differentiator**: Integrated Eisenhower + Goals + Briefings
3. **Tertiary Differentiator**: Offline-first like Things 3, but for Android

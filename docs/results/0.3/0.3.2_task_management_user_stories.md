## User Stories

### TM-001: Quick Task Capture

**Priority**: P0  
**Persona**: All (Alex, Maya, Jordan)

As a busy user, I want to capture a task in under 5 seconds so that I don't lose thoughts when they occur.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. [ ] Floating Action Button (FAB) visible on all main screens
2. [ ] Tap FAB → focus on text input within 200ms
3. [ ] Text input accepts natural language (e.g., "Call dentist tomorrow at 2pm")
4. [ ] "Save" button or Enter key saves task immediately
5. [ ] Haptic feedback confirms save
6. [ ] Task appears in list within 1 second
7. [ ] Works completely offline
8. [ ] Voice input option via microphone icon

**Technical Notes**:
- Use Android Speech-to-Text API for voice
- Parse natural language locally using AI (see TM-002)
- Store in Room database with optimistic UI

**Dependencies**: None (foundational feature)

### TM-002: Natural Language Task Parsing

**Priority**: P0  
**Persona**: Alex (Overwhelmed Professional), Jordan (Aspiring Achiever)

**Story**:  
As a user, I want to type or speak naturally when creating tasks so that I don't have to manually fill out form fields.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. [ ] Parse task title from natural language input
2. [ ] Extract due date/time (e.g., "tomorrow", "next Friday", "3pm")
3. [ ] Detect priority signals (e.g., "urgent", "important", "ASAP")
4. [ ] Identify project/area context if mentioned (e.g., "for work")
5. [ ] Show parsed interpretation before saving (editable preview)
6. [ ] Parsing works offline using on-device LLM
7. [ ] Fallback to simple title-only if parsing fails
8. [ ] Support common date formats (MM/DD, DD/MM configurable)

**Examples**:
| Input | Parsed Output |
|-------|--------------|
| "Call mom tomorrow at 5pm" | Title: "Call mom", Due: Tomorrow 5:00 PM |
| "urgent: finish report by Friday" | Title: "Finish report", Due: Friday, Priority: High |
| "buy groceries" | Title: "Buy groceries", Due: None |
| "dentist appointment next Tuesday morning" | Title: "Dentist appointment", Due: Next Tuesday 9:00 AM |

**Technical Notes**:
- Use Phi-3-mini for parsing
- Fallback to regex for simple patterns if LLM fails
- Cache common patterns for speed

**Dependencies**: On-device LLM integration (Milestone 0.2)

### TM-003: AI Eisenhower Classification

**Priority**: P0  
**Persona**: Alex (Overwhelmed Professional)

4. [ ] AI provides one-sentence explanation (e.g., "Has a deadline tomorrow")
5. [ ] User can override classification with one tap
6. [ ] Classification considers: deadline, keywords, user patterns
7. [ ] Works completely offline using on-device LLM
8. [ ] Show quadrant badge/indicator on task in list view
9. [ ] Accuracy target: 80%+ agreement with user overrides

**Technical Notes**:
- Use hybrid approach: rule-based for 75% cases, LLM for complex

# Task 0.3.5: MVP Scope Boundary

**Owner**: Product Manager  
**Duration**: 2h  
**Status**: Completed  
**Date**: February 3, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the explicit boundary between MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and post-MVP features. Clear scope boundaries prevent feature creep, maintain focus on core value, and ensure timely delivery.

**MVP Positioning**: "Your Private Productivity AI" — an Android app with on-device AI that automatically prioritizes tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix while keeping all data local.

**MVP Goal**: Deliver 80% of value with 20% of features. Ship a polished experience for core use cases rather than a broad feature set.

---

## Scope Decision Criteria

Features were evaluated against:

| Criterion | Question | MVP Standard |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Core Value** | Does this deliver the key differentiator? | Must support privacy, AI prioritization, or goal connection |
| **User Validation** | Do all 3 personas need this? | 2+ personas must benefit |
| **Technical Risk** | Is this achievable with current LLM research? | Must use proven Phi-3-mini capabilities |
| **Dependency** | Does this require backend infrastructure? | MVP is offline-first; no required backend |
| **Time** | Can this ship in 14 weeks? | Must fit in development timeline |
| **80/20 Test** | Is this in the vital 20%? | P0/P1 from 80/20 analysis only |

## OUT OF SCOPE: Post-MVP Features

### Explicitly Excluded from MVP

#### 1. Cloud & Sync Features
| Feature | Version | Rationale |

| Cloud sync across devices | V1.1 | Backend required; MVP is single-device |
| Cloud backup | V1.1 | Requires infrastructure |
| Multi-device access | V1.1 | Sync dependency |

#### 2. Platform Expansion
| Feature | Version | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| iOS app | V2.0 | Android-first strategy |
| Web app | V2.0 | Mobile-first focus |

#### 5. Advanced Features
| Feature | Version | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Trip planning | V2.0+ | Aspirational, not core |
| Health goals integration | V2.0 | Separate domain |
| Time blocking calendar write | V1.1 | Calendar write complex |
| Delegation to others | V2.0 | Requires user accounts |
| Team/family sharing | V2.0 | Multi-user complexity |
| Custom automation rules | V2.0 | Advanced feature |

#### 6. Monetization (MVP uses simple pricing only)
| Feature | Version | Rationale |

## Feature Comparison: MVP vs Competitors

| Feature | Jeeves MVP | Todoist | TickTick | Google Tasks |
|---------|------------|---------|----------|--------------|
| AI Eisenhower | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ Manual | ❌ |
| On-device AI | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Goal-task linking | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Daily briefings | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Meeting notes + AI | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Offline-first | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Cloud sync | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cross-platform | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Web app | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Team features | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

**Analysis**: MVP wins on differentiated features (AI, goals, briefings) while competitors win on platform breadth. This is intentional—we focus on depth of value, not breadth of platforms.

---

## User Story Count by Area

| Feature Area | P0 Stories | P1 Stories | Total |
|--------------|------------|------------|-------|
| Task Management | 7 | 3 | 10 |
| Goals & Progress | 4 | 2 | 6 |
| Calendar & Briefings | 3 | 3 | 6 |
| **Total** | **14** | **8** | **22** |

**MVP includes all 22 user stories** from documents 0.3.2, 0.3.3, and 0.3.4.

---

## Risk Mitigation for Scope

### Scope Creep Prevention

1. **Change Review Process**: Any new feature request evaluated against 80/20 criteria
2. **Feature Freeze**: Week 12 - no new features after this point
3. **P1 Buffer**: P1 features can slip to V1.1 if behind schedule
4. **MVP Definition Owner**: Product Manager has final say on scope

### What If We're Behind Schedule?

**P0 Features**: Non-negotiable - all must ship

**P1 Features** (in order of priority for cut):
1. Smart Briefing Insights (CB-006) - can ship with basic insights
2. Goal Analytics (GL-006) - can ship without charts
3. Evening Summary (CB-003) - can launch with morning only
4. Meeting Notes (CB-004) - can ship without action extraction

### What If We're Ahead of Schedule?

Move forward from V1.1:
1. Android widgets (high user demand expected)
2. Tags and projects (organization feature)
3. Procrastination nudges (engagement)

---

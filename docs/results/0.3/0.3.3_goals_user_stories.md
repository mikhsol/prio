## Connection to Core Differentiator

The Goals feature addresses a key market gap identified in competitive analysis:

> **Gap 3: Goal-Task Disconnect**
> "Goals live in separate apps from tasks. No single app connects long-term goals → actionable tasks → daily execution."

By implementing these 6 stories, Jeeves becomes the first productivity app to:
1. Create SMART goals with AI assistance
2. Link daily tasks to long-term goals
3. Visualize goal progress from task completion
4. Include goal-advancing tasks in daily briefings

This creates a powerful **switching cost**—users who build goal history in Jeeves won't want to leave.

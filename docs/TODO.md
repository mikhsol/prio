Asses the plan with knowledges about [positioning opportunities](/home/mikhail/projects/jeeves/docs/results/0.1/0.1.4_positioning_opportunities.md) and [user personas](/home/mikhail/projects/jeeves/docs/results/0.1/0.1.5_user_personas.md). What are missing from plan? Any features we need to add/remove from MVP? What can we do better? Do the pricing policy correct?
2. Analyze [Action Plan](/home/mikhail/projects/jeeves/docs/ACTION_PLAN.md) and /home/mikhail/projects/jeeves/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, /home/mikhail/projects/jeeves/docs/SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md, /home/mikhail/projects/jeeves/docs/DEVOPS_GUIDE.md, /home/mikhail/projects/jeeves/docs/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md. Based on knowledge from /home/mikhail/projects/jeeves/docs/results/0.1/0.1.3_on_device_llm_research.md assess what can be imporve, update plan and documentation. Make sure mobile app design in a way it would be easy to replace LLM model if necessary or plug-in backend based solution (llm in cloud with backend as a proxy).

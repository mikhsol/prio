## Ideas for future.
1. Split task to subtasks.
2. Agent specific to specific goal.
3. Personal/Work/etc... 
4. Identify duplicates.
5. Go through all reports and collect list of next steps/items which should be implemented later.
6. Tags for tasks/goals.
7. Pomodoro/flowtime.
8. Limit number of DO_IT tasks to 3.
9. Limint number of In Progress tasks to X.
10. Reasses tasks if it's more than Y in lists (do in background, suggest to user).
11. Notifications on/off in some time period.
12. Set up notification to specific interval (5-mins every hour/etc...)
13. Productivity recommendations.
14. Generate Videos on how to use app. Learn about marketing part of it (releases/how often/how to make it useful).
15. Beautiful animation on task/goal completion.
16. Time tracking.
17. iOS/Desktop app.
18. Completed tasks archived not deleted. Yearly/monthly/weekly summary on achieved tasks/goals, reflections on missed deadlines weekly.
19. 200 test cases for each topic (work/health/etc..) to classify tasks, educate classifier.
20. Export goals/tasks.
21. Soft delete/archive tasks/goals.
22. Task progress.
23. Delegate task to agent.
24. Email integration, suggest response.
25. Sync up notes from Notion.
26. Telegram/WhatsApp mini app/bot -> Send message to todo.
27. Separate personal to work spaces/user profies?
28. Integration with other apps.
29. Spell checker and auto formatting of the text fields.


## Bugs:
* [TASK] Poor UX, to save edited task you need to go to menu. Better experience would be have button "save" instead of "complete" in edit mode.
* [TASK] While creating a task and trying to edit details "change" button not working for all the fields (date, goal linked, does not repeate, no reminder).
* [TASK] Edit mode for task, type something in notes, try to add subtask, notes gone. Save notes while user typing it periodically.
* [TASK] Edit task name when press on task name in detailed view.

* [TASK] Last subtasks not saved after editing.
* [TASK] Subtasks completed after saving, without explicitly marking it as completed.
* [GOAL] Duplicat buttons to create goal when no goals (in the middle and at the bottom right corner).
* [GOAL] Create goal -> Add first task not working.
* [GOAL] How milstones related to tasks? Shoul it be relation?
* [GOAL] Create goal -> Add multiple milestones -> Last edded milestone not saved.
* [TASK] No time picke when choose date.
* [TASK] Recurrent tasks not implemented.
* [TASK] Reminder not implemented.
* [APP] Swipe left twice, leaving app.
* [CALENDAR] Month/Week/Day view.
* [TASK] Create task -> Edit -> You can create task by swipe left, but same time can complete it.
